# whack-a-penguin

Project created as part of tutorial in https://www.hackingwithswift.com. The main objectives are:

 - Build a game using SKCropNode and a sprinkling of Grand Central Dispatch.
 - Exercise SKCropNode, SKTexture, dispatch_after(), the *= and -= operators, forcing method parameter labels.
